The great state of Texas publishes a real-time dataset of all traffic accidents (updated every 5mins).
Possible question:
1) How did traffic accidents change during lockdown?
2) Is there any predictive power in knowing whether a particular area is in lockdown for predicting accidents?
3) (Suppose we can find another dataset from another state) Did the types of accidents change not only across time (before covid/during covid)
but is this change consistent among geograpic regions?
