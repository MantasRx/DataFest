The EU conducts a survey of different sectors of the economy to ascertain the level of confidence 
representatives of different sectors have in the economy. The data goes back to 1985 and is available for all EU countries.

Possible questions include:
1) Does the impact covid-19 has on each countries opinion of its own economy correlate with case numbers?
2) Is the change in economic sentiment consistent with economic downturns in the past (2008 or the dotcom crash)?
3) Does the change in sentiment vary by sector?
